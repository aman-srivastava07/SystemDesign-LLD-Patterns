# 🚀 Java Design Patterns Implementation  

This repository contains implementations of **commonly used design patterns** in Java. These patterns help in writing scalable, maintainable, and flexible code by following best software design practices.

## 🏆 Design Patterns Covered  

### **1️⃣ Creational Patterns**  
- **Singleton Pattern** – Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
- **Factory Pattern** – Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the object type.  

### **2️⃣ Structural Patterns**  
- **Adapter Pattern** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.  
- **Decorator Pattern** – Adds additional functionality to an object dynamically.  
- **Facade Pattern** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  
- **Proxy Pattern** – Controls access to another object, adding security or caching.  

### **3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns**  
- **Strategy Pattern** – Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each, and makes them interchangeable.  
- **Observer Pattern** – Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object are notified to others.  
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** – Passes a request along a chain of handlers.  
- **Command Pattern** – Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients.

## 🎯 When to Use These Patterns?
✔ Singleton – When you need a single instance of a class (e.g., Configuration Manager).
✔ Factory – When object creation logic is complex and needs to be centralized.
✔ Adapter – When two incompatible interfaces need to work together.
✔ Decorator – When you want to dynamically add behavior to objects.
✔ Facade – When you need a unified interface for a complex system.
✔ Proxy – When controlling access to an object (e.g., caching, security).
✔ Strategy – When you need to switch between multiple algorithms at runtime.
✔ Observer – When one object changes, and multiple others should update automatically.
✔ Chain of Responsibility – When multiple handlers process a request sequentially.
✔ Command – When you need to encapsulate requests as objects for queuing or logging.
